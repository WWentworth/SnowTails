# Snow Tails Dog Rescue

I am building an adoption app that would be aimed for rescue groups to promote animals they have up for adoption. Specifically, my app will focus on huskies,  malamutes and other sled dogs The target audience would be those who would are currently looking to adopt a pet. The app would allow you to see current pets listing their breed, age, temperament, and location.  

This application will allow the Snow Tails team member add locations and dogs to those locations. Possible adopters can then create a profile and apply for adoption.
